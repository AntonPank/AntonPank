# Clients

## View clients

This section contains information about all clients registered in the SMB Dashboard app. In addition, the unit allows you to view summary information on the client's business state. That is the general and financial information of the client, a list of insights, forecasts, scenarios, user applications, his third systems, and analytical widgets.

## Add new client

The clients' reports allow for overviewing statistics about clients: the number of all clients to a specific date, the number of active clients, the new clients for the period, and the client's renewal.
