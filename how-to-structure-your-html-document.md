# How to structure your HTML Document

### **Part 1 - HTML is a "markup language".**

> HTML Document has a predefined structure and components representing text and graphical elements of a web page. These elements are _"tagged"_ with special symbols, which allows a web browser to read and interpret the contents of the document as a code. Tags wrap up each element of the page. Although, tags may have attributes allowing developers to add some specific conditions to those elements, including styling and behavioral aspects.

For example:

```
<p>This line is represented as <strong>paragraph</strong> using tags.</p>
```

As seen from the code snippet above, tags can be placed inside other tagged elements. This peculiarity makes HTML extremely flexible in terms of customization of the page components. With its simple configuration and high-quality presentation, HTML evolved into a constituent instrument for displaying information on the Internet.

### **Part 2 - Basics of HTML Document Structure.**

> Every HTML document, regardless of its size and intention, has a preset structure. Although, this condition never changes, it does not affect flexibility of the language at all. Below is the example of a typical HTML document structure.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head> </head>

<body> </body>

</html>
```

Despite the simplicity, its possibilities are immense. The aforementioned elements are required for the browser to read the document as such that contains HTML. In particular:

_**!DOCTYPE html**_ - is a special label indicating that this is html document;

_**html**_ - defines the start and end of the document;

_**head**_ and _**body**_ - are sections nesting content and its properties.

***

### **Part 3 - The DOM Structure.**

> DOM is an abbreviation for _Document Object Model_. This concept defines structure of the HTML document, as understood by the browser - in form of an object model, namely a tree of objects. DOM also defines _Propoerties_, _Methods_, and _Events_ related to the HTML elements.

Here is the depiction of a typical DOM structure:

DOM is a very important component of the web. It allows pages to be dynamic hence, interactive. This, however, cannot be reached without _JavaScript_ - a web browser programming language. In this case, HTML DOM is an _API_ (Application Programming Interface), allowing JavaScript to perform the following operations:

* manipulate HTML elements
* manipulate HTML attributes
* manipulate HTML styles
* manipulate HTML events.

### Conclusion

Internet technologies are evolving every day. Since its foundation in 1993, HTML has been altered numerous times so that new versions of the language were unleashed. Its essential building blocks remain the same though, making the concept of this instrument along with other web development arrangements - one of the greatest inventions ever made.
