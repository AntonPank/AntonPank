# Analytics

## Analytics Widgets

The **Analytics** section contains analytics charts for all systems that can be connected in the **Apps** section. The analytics page represents charts in various formats, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tables and single values. The more apps, the more charts, and the more detailed diagnostics of your business you will have.
