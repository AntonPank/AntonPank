# Credit Score

## General

The Credit Score Component displays a business credit score – a number that demonstrates how creditworthy a business is and how likely it is for a business to pay back debts. The Component also allows for boosting the business credit score, getting valuable insights, and generating detailed reports.

## CrediSafe Monitoring

{% hint style="info" %}
Your monitoring updates are managed manually. See [Demo: How to Refresh app data](https://upswot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPSWOT/pages/1102675992/Credit+Score+Business+Web+Component)
{% endhint %}

The business credit score is updated every 30 days based on data received from a credit bureau. The system sends a file with a client’s connected apps to a credit bureau once a day.
