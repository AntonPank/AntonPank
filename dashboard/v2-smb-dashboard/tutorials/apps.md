# Apps

## Business applications ecosystem

The **Apps** section is intended for connecting your business apps to the upSWOT app. It contains a list of the most frequently used business apps.

**Connected Apps and Latest Updates.** The Apps section at the bottom of the systems that are already connected to the upSWOT system mentions when upSWOT was last connected to the system and when exactly the data was updated.
