# Invoices

## Invoices and Bills

The Invoices menu allows the client to send selected invoices/bills to an external company for factoring/payment.

The main page has two sections: **Invoices** and **Bills**.

## What is Payment Status

A Payment Status is a message that indicates how far that a payment has progressed. Payment Statuses are returned by Bank (ASPSP) APIs when TPPs initiate payments or request payment updates on behalf of customers (PSUs) using their application to make payments.

Knowing which Payment Statuses are available also helps TPPs manage customer issues.
